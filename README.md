# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Thibault Friedrich**, a french frontend developer and ux designer
self-designated expert in innovative user experiences.

I love everything about science-fiction and Ux Design.

I am available as a freelance and I also plan to found a new company in the next
few years as a externalized R&D service specialized in innovative user
experiences. If you are interested by this concept, contact me. I am open to
worlwide collaborations.
